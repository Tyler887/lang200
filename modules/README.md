# lang200 modules
***DO NOT EDIT THIS FOLDER TO ADD 3<sup><sup>RD</sup></sup>-PARTY LIBRARIES THAT HAPPEN TO BE HOSTED ON
A GIT SERVICE - CLONE THIS REPO AND ADD THE GIT SUBMODULE INSTEAD!***

This folder includes libraries for use with `lang200`. These should be entirely written in C, as the language
itself is written in C.

DO NOT ADD UNMAINTAINED LIBRARIES HERE. Instead, if you know C, reimplement it, else it's tough - I would
reimplement it instead "Relatively Soon<sup>TM</sup>".
