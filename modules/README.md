# lang200 modules
***DO NOT EDIT THIS FOLDER TO ADD 3<sup><sup>RD</sup></sup>-PARTY LIBRARIES THAT HAPPEN TO BE HOSTED ON
A GIT SERVICE - CLONE THIS REPO AND ADD THE GIT SUBMODULE INSTEAD!***

This folder includes libraries for use with `lang200`. These should be entirely written in C, as the language
itself is written in C.
